# Challenge-2-Porfolio
Title: Albert Alemam Webpage
Objective: Create a porfolio for future career applications showcasing our skills.
# Description
The main idea behind this project was to create an engaging, iviting, interactive profile that we as aspiring developers could use in our future career applications. 
My project at the moment is still in its begining phase. It includes a logo, nav bar, sidebar, body paragraph, and a footer. For this project I used various technologies such as youtube, tiktok,
and classroom notes and examples to assist me.
# Reflection 
Since this is the first time I have ever built a webpage. Although I still need much more practice and I don't have all the skills down yet. I was excited to see how much I have learned in the first week of bootcamp. I look forward to imporving my skill and performing better and more challenging tasks.
